Over 50 students, researchers, and instructors attended UBC’s sixth learning analytics hackathon on November 2 and 3, 2019, spending the weekend creating apps and dashboards to improve student learning and experiences. Learning analytics is an emerging field that aims to use educational data – such as activity data generated in learning management systems like Canvas – to improve teaching and learning.

For the first time, participants were given access to 5 years’ worth of UBC’s course calendar data, which includes descriptions, pre/co-requisites, enrolment numbers, instructor names, and more, about every course taught at UBC from 2014-2018.

Working as a team, we created a secure app with focus on data privacy, allowing students to see which courses they are eligible to take. Please refer to the final [presentation](https://github.com/kate-melnykova/CanvasAPI-Learning-Analytics/blob/master/LAHackathon_presentation_pdf.pdf) for the detailed explanation of the idea.
